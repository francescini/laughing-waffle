## Hazard Analysis
### Data Collection
- **Hazard:** Inclusion of biased, harmful, or sensitive data.
- **Control:** Implement strict data sourcing and filtering protocols.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Hazard:** Inadequate anonymization or filtering.
- **Control:** Apply robust anonymization and filtering techniques.

### Model Training
- **Hazard:** Training on biased or unrepresentative data.
- **Control:** Use diverse, representative datasets and apply bias mitigation techniques.

### Model Evaluation
- **Hazard:** Inadequate testing, leading to undetected issues.
- **Control:** Perform comprehensive testing including edge cases and stress tests.

### Deployment
- **Hazard:** Security vulnerabilities.
- **Control:** Implement strong security measures and regular audits.

### User Interaction
- **Hazard:** Generation of harmful, misleading, or biased content.
- **Control:** Apply content moderation, context understanding improvements, and user feedback mechanisms.

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Hazard:** Failure to detect and address issues post-deployment.
- **Control:** Implement continuous monitoring, regular updates, and anomaly detection systems.

## Critical Control Points (CCPs) and Critical Limits
### Data Collection
- **CCP:** Data Sourcing and Filtering
- **Critical Limits:** Only use verified and diverse data sources; filter out sensitive and harmful content.

### Model Training
- **CCP:** Bias Mitigation
- **Critical Limits:** Ensure datasets are balanced and representative; apply bias detection tools.

### User Interaction
- **CCP:** Content Moderation
- **Critical Limits:** Implement filters to block harmful content; improve context understanding to avoid misinterpretations.

## Monitoring Procedures
### Data Collection
- Regularly audit data sources.
- Continuously update filtering algorithms.

### Model Training
- Monitor training data for diversity and balance.
- Regularly test the model for bias and fairness.

### User Interaction
- Continuously monitor outputs for harmful content.
- Use user feedback to identify and address issues.

## Verification Procedures
- Conduct regular reviews and audits of the entire system.
- Validate that critical limits and controls are being adhered to.
- Perform independent evaluations and external audits.

## Corrective Actions
### Data Collection
- Remove and re-evaluate questionable data sources.
- Retrain the model if significant issues are found.

### Model Training
- Adjust training data and reapply bias mitigation techniques.
- Retrain the model with corrected data.

### User Interaction
- Update content moderation systems and improve context understanding.
- Address flagged outputs and implement fixes in real-time.

## Record-Keeping Procedures
- Document all data sources, preprocessing steps, and filtering methods.
- Maintain records of training data composition, bias mitigation efforts, and testing results.
- Keep logs of user interactions, moderation actions, and feedback.
